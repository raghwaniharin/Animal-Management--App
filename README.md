As students we had to create an app with Visual studio using .NET MAUI. The primary purpose of the app is to be connected to a database and create a front-end app
that will manipulate that data. I have created it in such a way that there is 
  1 page for viewing Data
  1 page for showing farm statistics
  1 page to update data
  1 page to delete data
  1 page to add data


this is such that when passing this app to users we can limit their access to some features and so some people will have access to only some pages
